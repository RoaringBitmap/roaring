## Testing

Please add a unit test if you are fixing a bug.

You must run 

```
go test
```

## Formatting

Please run 

```
go fmt
```

## Fuzzing

Please run our fuzzer on your changes.


1. Generate initial smat corpus:
```
go test -tags=gofuzz -run=TestGenerateSmatCorpus
```
You should see a directory `workdir` created with initial corpus files.

2. Run the fuzz test:
```
go test -run='^$' -fuzz=FuzzSmat -fuzztime=300s -timeout=60s
```

Adjust `-fuzztime` as needed for longer or shorter runs. If crashes are found,
check the test output and the reproducer files in the `workdir` directory.
You may copy the reproducers to roaring_tests.go

## Performance Impact

If applicable, describe any performance implications of these changes and include benchmark results.

### Running Benchmarks

This project includes comprehensive benchmarks. Please run relevant benchmarks before and after your changes:

#### Basic Benchmarks
```bash
# Run all benchmarks
go test -bench=. -run=^$

# Run with memory allocation statistics
go test -bench=. -benchmem -run=^$

# Run specific benchmark
go test -bench=BenchmarkIteratorAlloc -run=^$
```

#### Parallel Benchmarks
```bash
# Run parallel processing benchmarks
go test -bench=BenchmarkIntersectionLargeParallel -run=^$
```

#### Real Data Benchmarks
```bash
# Requires real-roaring-datasets (run: go get github.com/RoaringBitmap/real-roaring-datasets)
BENCH_REAL_DATA=1 go test -bench=BenchmarkRealData -run=^$
```

#### Benchmark Results Format
Please include before/after results in the following format:
```
BenchmarkName-8    1000000    1234 ns/op    567 B/op    12 allocs/op
```

### Performance Analysis
- Compare benchmark results before and after changes
- Note any significant improvements or regressions
- Include memory usage changes if relevant
- Mention any trade-offs (e.g., memory vs speed)
